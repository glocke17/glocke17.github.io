  <h1>Background of the Harry Potter Series</h1>
  <h2>About the Plot</h2>
    <p>Harry Potter is about the story of an orphan boy in a wizarding and fantasy world, who lost his parents to a dark wizard. He grows up with his Aunt and Uncle who no doubt shield him from his true self - the fact that he is a wizard, and a great one at that (as you will soon find out if you read the books or watch the movies).</p>

    <p>As the story progresses throughout the books and the movies, Harry as the protagonist, faces multiple different challenges while he attends Hogwarts, the school of witchcraft and wizardry. He faces multiple enemies, creatures, and drama between friends and romantic partners.</p>

    <p>Through the series we mainly see Harry struggle with being an orphan and being an orphan due to one person in particular - He Who Must Not Be Named - the evil being who killed his parents. Though, we see that the friends Harry makes along the way are there for him no matter what.</p>

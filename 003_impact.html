  <h1>The impact of Harry Potter on my life!</h1>
  <h2>Why did I chose this topic?</h2>
    <p>This series has had a HUGE impact on my life. Ever since I was younger, I can remember sitting down in my childhood home with my family members with a huge bowl of popcorn, turning the lights off and deciding what movie we wanted to watch.</p>

<p>Most often times we would debate for a while, with me and my sisters wanting chick flicks and my parents wanting action movies. We rarely agreed but we always had one fallback option that everyone was always willing to watchâ€¦ and that was Harry Potter.</p> 

<p>I remember my oldest sister and my Dad venturing out late at night for the releases of the books at midnight and for the releases of the midnight showings of the movies - one of which I went to myself when I got older.</p>

<p>It was such a huge part of my life that on vacation in Florida one morning, we all woke up at 4 am and attended the grand opening of the Harry Potter theme park at Universal Studios. We waited in line for over 6 hours, but let me tell you, it was worth it. While we were there, Emma Watson was actually there too!</p>
